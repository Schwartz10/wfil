# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat deploy
npx hardhat name --contract 0xFF000000000000000000000000000000000004CC --network wallaby
npx hardhat deposit --contract 0xFF000000000000000000000000000000000004CC --network wallaby
```
